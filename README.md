# GitHub Topic Explorer

## Assignment:

Your task is to build a React web application that displays all the "[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#topic)" related to the term "react", using the GitHub GraphQL API.

The application should display how many "[stargazers](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#stargazerconnection)" each topic has. A click on a topic should display the topics related to that topic, and how many stargazers they have. And so forth.

To interact with the Github GraphQL API you'll need to have
  * a [Github API key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql)
  * You'll want to make use of the key in the .env file within your application

You may use whatever React framework or library you find useful. URL routing is optional.


## Evaluation:

* We will pay particular attention to the way the code is organized, and to the overall readability
* Unit tests will be greatly appreciated
* Design will be ignored, however usability and accessibility will be taken into consideration
* Remember to update this README with instructions on how to install, run and test your application
* Your first goal is to have a working app, but feel free to improve the application however you see fit
* We hope that you can complete the assignment within 2 hours but don't set any time constraints
* Please reach out per email or by opening an issue if anything is unclear or blocking you

Best of luck
